=head1 NAME

[ this is a template for a new perldelta file.  Any text flagged as XXX needs
to be processed before release. ]

perldelta - what is new for perl v5.17.4

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes differences between the 5.17.3 release and the 5.17.4
release.

If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.17.2, first read
L<perl5173delta>, which describes differences between 5.17.2 and 5.17.3.

=head1 Notice

XXX Any important notices here

=head1 Core Enhancements

XXX New core language features go here.  Summarize user-visible core language
enhancements.  Particularly prominent performance optimisations could go
here, but most should go in the L</Performance Enhancements> section.

[ List each enhancement as a =head2 entry ]

=head2 Latest Unicode 6.2 beta is included

This is supposed to be the final data for 6.2, unless glitches are
found.  The earlier experimental 6.2 beta data has been reverted, and
this used instead.  Not all the changes that were proposed for 6.2 and
that were in the earlier beta versions are actually going into 6.2.  In
particular, there are no changes from 6.1 in the General_Category of any
characters.  6.2 does revise the C<\X> handling for the REGIONAL
INDICATOR characters that were added in Unicode 6.0.  Perl now for the
first time fully handles this revision.

=head2 New DTrace probes

The following new DTrace probes have been added:

=head1 Security

XXX Any security-related notices go here.  In particular, any security
vulnerabilities closed should be noted here rather than in the
L</Selected Bug Fixes> section.

[ List each security issue as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Incompatible Changes

XXX For a release on a stable branch, this section aspires to be:

    There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.XXX.XXX
    If any exist, they are bugs, and we request that you submit a
    report.  See L</Reporting Bugs> below.

[ List each incompatible change as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Deprecations

XXX Any deprecated features, syntax, modules etc. should be listed here.  In
particular, deprecated modules should be listed here even if they are listed as
an updated module in the L</Modules and Pragmata> section.

[ List each deprecation as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Performance Enhancements

XXX Changes which enhance performance without changing behaviour go here.
There may well be none in a stable release.

=item *

Speed up in regular expression matching against Unicode properties.  The
largest gain is for C<\X>, the Unicode "extended grapheme cluster".  The
gain for it is about 35% - 40%.  Bracketed character classes, e.g.,
C<[0-9\x{100}]> containing code points above 255 are also now faster.

=item *

On platforms supporting it, several former macros are now implemented as static
inline functions. This should speed things up slightly on non-GCC platforms.

=item *

Apply the optimisation of hashes in boolean context, such as in C<if> or C<and>,
to constructs in non-void context.

=item *

Extend the optimisation of hashes in boolean context to C<scalar(%hash)>,
C<%hash ? ... : ...>, and C<sub { %hash || ... | }>.

=item *

When making a copy of the string being matched against (so that $1, $& et al
continue to show the correct value even if the original string is subsequently
modified), only copy that substring of the original string needed for the
capture variables, rather than copying the whole string.

This is a big win for code like

    $&;
    $_ = 'x' x 1_000_000;
    1 while /(.)/;

Also, when pessimizing if the code contains C<$`>, C<$&> or C<$'>, record the
presence of each variable separately, so that the determination of the substring
range is based on each variable separately. So performance-wise,

   $&; /x/

is now roughly equivalent to

   /(x)/

whereas previously it was like

   /^(.*)(x)(.*)$/

and

   $&; $'; /x/

is now roughly equivalent to

   /(x)(.*)$/

etc.

=head1 Modules and Pragmata

XXX All changes to installed files in F<cpan/>, F<dist/>, F<ext/> and F<lib/>
go here.  If Module::CoreList is updated, generate an initial draft of the
following sections using F<Porting/corelist-perldelta.pl>, which prints stub
entries to STDOUT.  Results can be pasted in place of the '=head2' entries
below.  A paragraph summary for important changes should then be added by hand.
In an ideal world, dual-life modules would have a F<Changes> file that could be
cribbed.

=item *

L<Archive::Tar> has been upgraded from version 1.88 to 1.90.  This adds
documentation fixes.

=item *

L<B> has been upgraded from version 1.37 to 1.38.  This makes the module work
with the new pad API.

=item *

L<B::Concise> has been upgraded from version 0.92 to 0.93.  This adds support
for the new C<OpMAYBE_TRUEBOOL> and C<OPpTRUEBOOL> flags.

=item *

L<B::Deparse> has been upgraded from version 1.16 to 1.17.  This suppresses
trailing semicolons in formats.

=item *

L<DB_File> has been upgraded from version 1.826 to 1.827.  The main Perl module
no longer uses the C<"@_"> construct.

=item *

L<Devel::Peek> has been upgraded from version 1.09 to 1.10.  This fixes
compilation with C++ compilers and makes the module work with the new pad API.

=item *

L<DynaLoader> has been upgraded from version 1.15 to 1.16.  This fixes warnings
about using C<CODE> sections without an C<OUTPUT> section.

=item *

L<ExtUtils::ParseXS> has been upgraded from version 3.17 to 3.18.  This avoids a
bogus warning for initialised XSUB non-parameters.

=item *

L<File::Copy> has been upgraded from version 2.23 to 2.24.  C<copy()> no longer
zeros files when copying into the same directory, and also now fails (as it has
long been documented to do) when attempting to copy a file over itself.

=item *

L<File::Find> has been upgraded from version 1.21 to 1.22.  This fixes
inconsistent unixy path handling on VMS.

=item *

L<Locale::Codes> has been upgraded from version 3.22 to 3.23.  It includes some
new codes.

=item *

L<Module::CoreList> has been upgraded from version 2.71 to 2.73.  This restores
compatibility with older versions of perl and cleans up the corelist data for
various modules.

=item *

L<Opcode> has been upgraded from version 1.23 to 1.24 to reflect the removal of
the boolkeys opcode.

=item *

L<Socket> has been upgraded from version 2.004 to 2.006.
C<unpack_sockaddr_in()> and C<unpack_sockaddr_in6()> now return just the IP
address in scalar context, and C<inet_ntop()> now guards against incorrect
length scalars being passed in.

=item *

L<threads::shared> has been upgraded from version 1.40 to 1.41.  This adds the
option to warn about or ignore attempts to clone structures that can't be
cloned, as opposed to just unconditionally dying in that case.

=item *

L<XSLoader> has been upgraded from version 0.15 to 0.16.

The APIs for accessing lexical pads have changed considerably.

C<PADLIST>s are now longer C<AV>s, but their own type instead. C<PADLIST>s now
contain a C<PAD> and a C<PADNAMELIST> of C<PADNAME>s, rather than C<AV>s for the
pad and the list of pad names.  C<PAD>s, C<PADNAMELIST>s, and C<PADNAME>s are to
be accessed as such though the newly added pad API instead of the plain C<AV>
and C<SV> APIs.  See L<perlapi> for details.

Restore ‘Can’t localize through ref’ to lvalue subs.  This error had disappeared
under certain conditions in version 5.16.0 and has now been restored.

=item *

The parsing of heredocs has been improved significantly, fixing several parsing
bugs and correcting wrong subsequent line numbers under certain conditions.

=item *

Reset the utf8 position cache when accessing magical variables to avoid the
string buffer and the utf8 position cache to get out of sync.

=item *

Various cases of get magic being called twice for magical utf8 strings have been
fixed.

=item *

This code (when not in the presence of C<$&> etc)

    $_ = 'x' x 1_000_000;
    1 while /(.)/;

used to skip the buffer copy for performance reasons, but suffered from C<$1>
etc changing if the original string changed.  That's now been fixed.

Perl doesn't use PerlIO anymore to report out of memory messages, as PerlIO
might attempt to allocate more memory.

=head1 Reporting Bugs

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles recently
posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at
http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/ .  There may also be information at
http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home Page.

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the L<perlbug> program
included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of C<perl -V>,
will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.

If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please send it
to perl5-security-report@perl.org.  This points to a closed subscription
unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core committers, who will be
able to help assess the impact of issues, figure out a resolution, and help
co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix the problem across all
platforms on which Perl is supported.  Please only use this address for
security issues in the Perl core, not for modules independently distributed on
CPAN.
